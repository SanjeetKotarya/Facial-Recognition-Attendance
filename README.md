This is a Python-based application that automates student attendance by detecting and recognizing faces through a live camera feed. The system uses 'OpenCV' for real-time video processing, 'face_recognition' for accurate facial detection, and 'Tkinter' for a user-friendly GUI. Attendance is marked automatically when students are recognized, and the attendance list is updated in real-time.

Features:
- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Dynamic GUI displaying camera feed and attendance list
- CSV-based student data management

Technologies: Python, OpenCV, face_recognition, Tkinter, Numpy
